Version 0.3.2

- The modes and all their commands can be declared in any order
in the *.cli files.
Previously, all modes needed to be created before the commands 
Specifically, if a command wanted to be available to a given
mode, that mode needed to be created explicity first within a 
mode section.
- No need for lex/yacc because their generated *.c and *.h 
files are already provided. This avoids compatibility problems
with different versions while generating the C files. 
However, if you want to generate them yourself, enter
'gmake clean_lex_yacc', 'gmake clean' and 'gmake'
- The configuration options --confdir, --commandsdir and --logdir
given in the 'configure' script can now be located in any dir 
where you have write access. This way the --confdir and --logdir
can be in different filesystem (for example, cramfs and tmpfs).
--commandsdir is only used for generating the final exec, it
isn't used at execution time.
- Added reserved word 'netmask' to grammar.
This new token can be checked with the func is_netmask()
- Improved logging mechanism.
- Improved debug info of the RHAL.
- Add the INSTALL file.
- Fix a serious bug that didn't allow the optional args
that have a parent arg to appear in the final graph
- Fix the IP address validation
- A lot of minor bugs were fixed.


Version 0.3.1

- The graph_static_generator is executed correctly when
compiling.
- Substitue the '//' comments with '/* */' due that they're
not ANSI C standard 
- The 'shell' cmd works as expected if 'bash' is available
- Add the tarasca.h file. Now the users only need
to add this file to their *.c and *.h files instead 
of the several Tarasca *.h files
- Rename the API functions with the suffix trs_*
to avoid confusion with user-defined or other
libraries functions (breaks compatibility with previous 
versions).
- Several small bugs were fixed.


Version 0.3.0

- configure script created that solves several problems
with default paths and options.
- The executable generated 'crish' can be called not only
from a terminal, but from some other script/shell/program.
These means that can be used from a GUI. It's still alpha
- The client/server model dissappears and the map_cmd_func
utility is changed by the graph_static_generator that is
executed when compiling. In this way there is no need for having
the configuration files in the production (target) system.
- Updated documentation.
- Several bugs were fixed.
